# Objective

To have a C++ build system that:

- can cross-compile to Linux, macOS, and Windows
- checks for build reproducibility
- has three checking modes: bootstrap, enforcing, and permissive
- has short and simple config files
- automagically detects new files
- automagically produces sane compilation rules
